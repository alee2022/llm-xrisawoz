He also discussed gender equality, freedom of speech, and transgender rights in an interview with Cathy Newman.\\nUser: Wow, he seems to cover a wide range of topics. What is his stance on gender equality and transgender rights?\\nWikiChat: Jordan Peterson stated that he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under compelled speech. He also objected to the Canadian government\\'s Bill C-16, which proposed to add \"gender identity or expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Peterson stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential free-speech implications if the Criminal Code were amended, saying he could then be prosecuted under provincial human-rights laws if he refused to call a transgender student or faculty member by the individual\\'s preferred pronoun. He also supports Pierre Lemieux\\'s campaign against federal legislation that proposes to add \"gender expression\" and \"gender identify\" as defining factors for discrimination in the Criminal Code and Canadian Human Rights Act.\\nUser: That\\'s an interesting perspective. I can see how compelled speech could be seen as a violation of free speech, but at the same time, I think it\\'s important to respect people\\'s gender identities and use their preferred pronouns. Have there been any notable responses to Peterson\\'s stance on this issue?\\nWikiChat: On 16 January 2018, Cathy Newman interviewed Canadian psychologist and author Jordan Peterson about gender equality, the gender pay gap, freedom of speech, and transgender rights.

It is driven by the “survival of the fittest” principle, where those individuals with more desirable traits are more likely to reproduce and pass their genes onto the next generation, while those with less desirable traits perish. Over time, this leads to the development of new species which are better suited to the environment. Artificial selection, on the other hand, involves humans directly selecting which organisms are able to reproduce. Unlike natural selection, this is a conscious decision where humans selectively choose which organisms gain reproductive advantages. This is done in order to produce organisms with a desired trait or characteristic, such as larger fruits or better yields.
